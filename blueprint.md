Sweet & tasty

This project is a modern, responsive landing page for a bubble tea shop called "Sweet & tasty".

## Design and Features

*   **Color Palette:** The design uses a vibrant and inviting color scheme with a pink background, purple text, and white accents.
*   **Typography:** It features a modern, rounded sans-serif font (Poppins) for a friendly and clean look.
*   **Header:** A clean header with a logo and navigation links.
*   **Sticky Header:** A floating "capsule" header appears on scroll for easy navigation.
*   **Hero Section:** A prominent hero section with a catchy title, a brief description, and call-to-action buttons.
*   **Illustrations:** The page uses a large, eye-catching illustration of bubble tea.
*   **Responsive:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including a mobile-friendly menu.

## Current Plan

*   **HTML Structure:** Update the HTML to create the new header, hero section, and footer.
*   **CSS Styling:** Replace the existing stylesheet with new CSS to implement the color scheme, fonts, and layout of the new design.
*   **JavaScript Functionality:** Add JavaScript to control the visibility of the sticky header on scroll and to manage the mobile menu.
